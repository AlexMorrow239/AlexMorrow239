### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am pursuing a dual major in computer science and data science & artificial intelligence, with a minor in mathematics, at the University of Miami. I expect to graduate in 2027 with a bachelor of science degree and a master of science degree in computer science. I have completed multiple projects that demonstrate my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and fundamental understanding of data structures and algorithms. For example, I authored a research paper on the effects of parental health discourse on their children, using data analysis and machine learning techniques to extract insights from a large dataset of online conversations. I also led a tutoring team within an exclusive college preparatory program, where I managed technical logistics and effectively communicated academic topics to students. I am eager to apply my technical expertise to real-world challenges, and I bring a strong commitment to learning and a passion for delivering seamless user experiences. I am actively looking for an internship in back-end development, and I would love to connect and explore how I can contribute to your team's success.
